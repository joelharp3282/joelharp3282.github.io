### A Little Introduction
Hello I am Joey Harp. I am part of the Branded Asset Team here at. I help to take care to preserve the magic by saving important assets from all of our parks and resorts, from our ride vehicles and props to unique hotel room furniture and costumes. 
<br><br>
I am involved with updating and maintaining the asset database. I am hoping to start implementing some spatial data analysis to better track our assets from which ones and from where they came from in the near future.
